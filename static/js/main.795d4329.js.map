Поэтому берегите себя и&nbsp;свою карму.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"rating\">Что такое рейтинг?</h2>\n\n    <p>Еще один параметр, определяющий вес пользователя на&nbsp;ресурсе.</p>\n\n    <p>Чем больше рейтинг участника, тем выше он&nbsp;находится в&nbsp;общем списке пользователей.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Рейтинг</strong> - это динамичный показатель, зависящий от&nbsp;активности пользователя на&nbsp;сайте: все плюсы и&nbsp;минусы к&nbsp;публикациям и&nbsp;комментариям прямым образом влияют на&nbsp;величину рейтинга (но&nbsp;не&nbsp;влияют на&nbsp;карму, как отмечалось выше). Если кто-то положительно оценивает ваши публикации и&nbsp;комментарии, то&nbsp;рейтинг будет расти (справедливо и&nbsp;обратное), но&nbsp;если бездействовать, то&nbsp;со&nbsp;временем рейтинг примет нулевое значение. </p>\n\n    <p>Впрочем, даже если проявлять активность, рейтинг всё равно будет падать: за&nbsp;былые заслуги. Иногда он&nbsp;начинает жить своей жизнью, и&nbsp;это нормально.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Наглядный пример.</strong> Допустим, вы&nbsp;написали публикацию с&nbsp;рейтингом +100&nbsp;— это добавило к&nbsp;вашему персональному рейтингу величину Х.&nbsp;Через несколько десятков дней этот самый&nbsp;Х вычтется, тем самым вернув вас на&nbsp;прежнее место.</p>\n\n    <p>Это явление называется пессимизацией рейтинга и&nbsp;создано для того, чтобы общий рейтинг пользователей был максимально объективным&nbsp;— возглавить его может даже только что пришедший новичок. Вывод простой: чтобы удерживать позицию лидера, нужно постоянно публиковать интересные статьи (которые будут набирать высокий рейтинг).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"voting\">Голосование</h2>\n\n    <p>Выше приведён перечень возможностей в&nbsp;зависимости от&nbsp;кармы&nbsp;— если она у&nbsp;вас будет положительная, то&nbsp;вы&nbsp;сможете голосовать (как когда-то кто-то голосовал за&nbsp;вас). Технически всё просто&nbsp;— в&nbsp;футере каждой публикации есть стрелочки «Вверх» и&nbsp;«Вниз», повышающие и&nbsp;понижающие рейтинг публикации на&nbsp;1&nbsp;единицу. У&nbsp;комментариев и&nbsp;ответов стрелки голосования находятся в&nbsp;правой части. Везде можно проголосовать лишь однажды, изменив рейтинг лишь на&nbsp;1&nbsp;единицу.</p>\n\n    <p>Для голосования за&nbsp;карму пользователя нужно либо пройти в&nbsp;его профиль, либо проголосовать со&nbsp;страницы публикации пользователя (показатели пользователя размещены в&nbsp;шапке его публикаций), либо при наведении на&nbsp;никнейм пользователя в&nbsp;комментариях, с&nbsp;помощью всплывающей плашки автора.</p>\n\n    <p>Стрелки изменения кармы находятся по&nbsp;обе стороны от&nbsp;числа, показывающего нынешний уровень кармы. Карму каждого пользователя можно также изменять лишь на&nbsp;1&nbsp;единицу («Вверх» или «Вниз»), но&nbsp;сам полюс оценки можно со&nbsp;временем поменять. То&nbsp;есть, однажды повысив карму кому-то из&nbsp;пользователей, вы&nbsp;сможете потом изменить её&nbsp;на&nbsp;противоположную (если вдруг появится такая необходимость). Само собой, голосовать за&nbsp;свою карму нельзя.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"recovery\">Как восстановить аккаунт?</h2>\n\n    <p>Если так получилось, что ваша карма стала отрицательной и&nbsp;вам хотелось&nbsp;бы это исправить&nbsp;— такая возможность есть.</p>\n\n    <p>Как известно, бороться надо с&nbsp;причиной, а&nbsp;не&nbsp;со&nbsp;следствием. Скорее всего, отрицательная карма является следствием некорректного поведения на&nbsp;сайте, так что комплексный анализ ошибок позволит не&nbsp;наступать на&nbsp;одни и&nbsp;те&nbsp;же грабли в&nbsp;дальнейшем.</p>\n\n    <p>Ну&nbsp;а&nbsp;потом есть несколько вариантов:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Recovery mode.</strong> У&nbsp;пользователей с&nbsp;отрицательной кармой (до&nbsp;−30&nbsp;включительно) есть шанс вернуться в&nbsp;ряды <a href=\"/#/info/help/habracentre/#badgets\">захабренных</a>&nbsp;— раз в&nbsp;неделю есть возможность написать публикацию или перевод в&nbsp;любой <a href=\"/#/info/help/hubs/\">профильный хаб</a>. У&nbsp;таких публикаций будет пометка «Recovery Mode»&nbsp;— если повезёт, то&nbsp;сообщество оценит старания и&nbsp;вытащит пользователя из&nbsp;кармаямы.</li>\n\n      <li><strong>Reset.</strong> Эта опция находится в&nbsp;<a href=\"/#/info/help/habracentre/\">хабрацентре</a> и&nbsp;позволяет обнулить любую (как положительную, так и&nbsp;сильно отрицательную) карму. Крайняя мера на&nbsp;тот случай, когда уже ничто другое не&nbsp;помогает, или хочется начать «с&nbsp;чистого листа». Но&nbsp;имейте в&nbsp;виду, что воспользоваться этой опцией можно только один раз за&nbsp;всё время регистрации на&nbsp;сайте. Мы&nbsp;даём второй шанс, но&nbsp;только однажды.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Ещё можно попытаться писать восхитительные комментарии, но&nbsp;это вряд&nbsp;ли поможет оперативно выйти из&nbsp;большого минуса.</p>\n\n    <h2>Другие рейтинги</h2>\n\n    <p>Раз уж&nbsp;мы&nbsp;заговорили о&nbsp;рейтингах, то&nbsp;огласим сразу весь список:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"/#/top/\">Рейтинг публикаций</a><br/></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/#/companies/\">Рейтинг компаний</a><br/></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/#/hubs/\">Рейтинг хабов</a><br/></li>\n      <li><a href=\"/#/users/\">Рейтинг людей</a><br/></li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>В&nbsp;общем и&nbsp;целом принцип работы везде один: чем выше активность, тем выше рейтинг.</p>\n  </div>\n)\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/InfoHelpKarma.js","import React from 'react'\n\nexport default () => (\n  <div className=\"info_page\">\n    <p><strong>Лента</strong>&nbsp;— это поток публикаций, настроенный в&nbsp;соответствии с&nbsp;вашими интересами.

Если она пройдет проверку модератором на&nbsp;соответствие тематике сайта, то&nbsp;или сразу получит приглашение от&nbsp;модераторов, или окажется в&nbsp;общей Песочнице, которую читают пользователи. И&nbsp;кто-то вполне сможет выдать вам приглашение, после чего аккаунт станет полноценным.</li>\n\n      <li>быть сотрудником компании, которая ведет на&nbsp;«Хабре» корпоративный блог, и&nbsp;писать для него. В&nbsp;таких случаях администратор блога может использовать приглашения компании для перевода вашего аккаунта в&nbsp;полноценный.</li>\n\n      <li>быть другом пользователя, у&nbsp;которого есть приглашение. Такой пользователь может самостоятельно использовать своё приглашения для вашего аккаунта, будь&nbsp;то ReadOnly или Read&amp;Comment (только если ваш аккаунт в&nbsp;ReadOnly не&nbsp;потому, что вы&nbsp;нарушали правила).</li>\n\n      <li>выиграть приглашение в&nbsp;конкурсах, временами проводимых в&nbsp;наших официальных группах <a href=\"http://vk.com/habr\">ВКонтакте</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/habrahabr\">Twitter</a> или <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/habrahabr.ru\">Facebook</a>.</li>\n\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Некоторые сомнительные ресурсы предлагают продажу приглашений на&nbsp;«Хабр», но&nbsp;этим стоит пользоваться только в&nbsp;случаях, если хочется и&nbsp;заплатить кому-то, и&nbsp;всё равно остаться без аккаунта. Будьте бдительны.</p>\n\n    <p>А&nbsp;вот способы заработать приглашение для друга (или просто про запас), если у&nbsp;вас уже есть полноценный аккаунт:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>набрать 50&nbsp;единиц кармы (даётся 1&nbsp;приглашение единовременно, даже если карму после этого понизят&nbsp;— приглашение остаётся на&nbsp;балансе аккаунта);</li>\n\n      <li>написать публикацию, которая после окончания срока голосования получит рейтинг выше +50.

Попытки поместить такую рекламу вне указанных разделов влекут за&nbsp;собой понижение прав аккаунта. На&nbsp;первый раз&nbsp;— временно.<br/>\n      Для рекламы и&nbsp;анонсов событий или мероприятий следует использовать возможности корпоративных блогов.<br/>\n      Обратите внимание&nbsp;— не&nbsp;имеет значения, рекламируете&nbsp;ли вы&nbsp;платный продукт или бесплатный. Если это OpenSource-решение, достаточно ссылки на&nbsp;GitHub, ссылка&nbsp;же на&nbsp;собственный сайт проекта&nbsp;— это уже реклама. Для продвижения youtube-каналов и&nbsp;групп в&nbsp;соцсетях следует также использовать «Я&nbsp;пиарюсь».<br/>\n      Однако, в&nbsp;настройках профиля пользователя или компании вы&nbsp;можете указать несколько ссылок на&nbsp;собственные ресурсы и&nbsp;социальные аккаунты, которые будут отображаться в&nbsp;вашем профиле, а&nbsp;также в&nbsp;блоке с&nbsp;информацией об&nbsp;авторе после текста публикации.</li>\n\n      <li><strong>Заниматься копипастом и&nbsp;кросспостом.</strong> Мы&nbsp;всячески приветствуем интересный и&nbsp;полезный сообществу контент, но&nbsp;только если он&nbsp;оригинальный.
